#### Background on Malware Analysis 

As a malware researcher, a significant part of our research process is dedicated to reversing cryptographic algorithms for extracting the decrypted content. Revealing this content provides an access to the core parts of the malware which includes but not limited to -

```
Strings
Windows API calls
DGA Algorithms
Communication protocols
Financial malware â€“ Includes the list of targeted institutions and webinjects.
```

#### Static
	Basic
		* File Identification
		* Scanner and sandboxes
		* File format analysis(PE header)
		* Identifying obfuscation
		* IOCs
	Advanced - Using disassembler to analyze low-level instructions
	
#### Dynamic  
	Basic - Executes in sandbox and relies upon tools results  
	Advanced - Debugging and control execution of program
		
#### Free EDR tools  
	Osquery(hybrid)  
	GRR

#### IOCs
	YARA - Each rule consists of a set of strings and a Boolean expression, which determines its logic.
