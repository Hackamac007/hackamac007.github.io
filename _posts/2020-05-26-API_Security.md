#### How does network security work?
Network security combines multiple layers of defenses at the edge and in the network. Each network security layer implements policies and controls. Authorized users gain access to network resources, but malicious actors are blocked from carrying out exploits and threats.

### Common API security issues
* Access controls
* Authorization
* Authentication
* Rate limiting
* Input validation
* Restricting HTTP methods
* 3rd party API abuse
* Other app logic errors
