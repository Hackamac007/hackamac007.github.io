My name is H@x0r. I am passoinate Cyber Security enthusiast and some of the key interests are - 

*  Web Application Penetration Testing(WAPT)  
*  Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing(VAPT)  
*  Network Penetration Testing (NPT)  
*  Automation with Shell Scripting

### Languages  
Java • Linux • SQL Python • Bash • Assembly Lua • YARA • Docker • Kubernetes  

### Tools 
•	Wireshark • Nessus • OllyDbg •	IDA Pro • Autospy • Splunk •	Nmap • Burp Suite • Metasploit • Drozer • Introspy

### Goal

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just google -[What it takes to earn OSCP](https://www.google.com/search?ei=eDDNXtKqNfOf4-EPjZe86As&q=What+it+takes+to+earn+oscp&oq=What+it+takes+to+earn+oscp&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIECAAQRzIECAAQRzIECAAQRzIECAAQRzIECAAQRzIECAAQRzIECAAQRzIECAAQR1AAWABgi8wRaABwAXgAgAEAiAEAkgEAmAEAqgEHZ3dzLXdpeg&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwjSxoGH59HpAhXzzzgGHY0LD70Q4dUDCAw&uact=5) 
and it will answer all your questions.

### Note
* First, you have to believe that you are qualified, then you have to convince someone else (the recruiter/hiring manager) that you are qualified.
* Skills may be outdated, but passion to reskill and upskill is something I believe in. 
* Push your learnings to catapult your confidence to next level
* Repetition until your learning becomes unconscious
